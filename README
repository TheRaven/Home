Voice recognition program using Scala

Uses the Java spec with cloudgarden's implementation (http://cloudgarden.com/) for voice recognition and text to speech.
Uses itunesController from http://dot-totally.co.uk/software/itunescon/ (which uses Jacob a com library)

Keep in mind that I use this project as a learning experience in Scala :D
